# 🐍 Python Learning

This repository contains my step-by-step journey of learning **Python programming** from the basics to advanced concepts.  
I am solving 140+ practice problems (from the attached PDF) to strengthen my understanding of **syntax, data structures, logic building, and problem solving**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each solution is saved as an individual Python file for clarity and easy reference.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- ✅ Master Python **syntax & control flow**
- ✅ Practice with **loops, functions, conditionals**
- ✅ Explore **data structures**: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- ✅ Strengthen **string operations & file handling**
- ✅ Build a foundation for **data engineering** (ETL, automation, cloud, Spark)

🚀 Progress Tracking

Programs completed: 17 / 140

Currently working on: Core Syntax & Data Structures

Next milestone: Mini projects (Contact Book, CSV Cleaner)

📌 Notes

This repo is for self-practice & learning consistency.

I will also push mini projects at the end of each learning phase.

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome via Pull Requests.

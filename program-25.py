'''Write a Python Program To Find ASCII value of a character.
ASCII value:
ASCII, or American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding
standard that uses numeric values to represent characters. Each ASCII character is
assigned a unique 7-bit or 8-bit binary number, allowing computers to exchange information
and display text in a consistent way. The ASCII values range from 0 to 127 (for 7-bit ASCII)
or 0 to 255 (for 8-bit ASCII), with each value corresponding to a specific character, such as
letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters.'''

char = input("Enter a character: ")
print(f"The ASCII value of '{char}' is {ord(char)}")
